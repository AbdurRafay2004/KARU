**Rule: Continuous Documentation & Progress Tracking**
"Upon completing any significant task, feature, or architectural change, you MUST immediately update the README.md file. This update acts as the project's 'Save State' and must include:

1.  **Current Status:** A summary of the latest completed milestone (e.g., '✅ Phase 1 Complete').
    
2.  **Implementation Log:** A checked list of specific features or components just added.
    
3.  **Immediate Next Steps:** An updated, prioritized to-do list for the next session.
    
4.  **Known Issues/Notes:** Any technical debt or bugs discovered during this step._Constraint:_ Treat README.md as the single source of truth for project state. Always read it before starting new tasks to ground your context."
