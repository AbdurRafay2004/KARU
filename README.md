## Architecture Analysis (Deep Dive)
*Analysis Date: Jan 2026*

A critical review of the current codebase reveals three major flaws preventing the platform from being "industry-grade".

### 1. Critical Security Flaws (RBAC)
- **Issue**: The `convex/admin.ts` mutations (`addProduct`, `updateProduct`) and `orders.ts` (`updateOrderStatus`) have **no authorization checks**.
- **Impact**: Any logged-in user (buyer) can manually trigger these mutations to delete products or change order statuses if they know the API.
- **Root Cause**: The backend relies on the UI to hide buttons, but does not verify `user.id` against `artisan.ownerId` on the server.

### 2. Disconnected Identity System
- **Issue**: `Users` (Auth) and `Artisans` (Profiles) are in separate, unlinked tables.
- **Impact**: The system has no way to know if a logged-in user is an artisan. There is no concept of "logging in as a seller".
- **Current Workaround**: The `/admin` page loads *all* artisans and lets anyone select one to manage.

### 3. Missing UX & Navigation
- **Issue**: The current Header is static. It does not reflect the rich, logged-in state expected of a marketplace (e.g., Etsy).
- **Missing**:
    -   No User Dropdown (Profile, Orders, Settings).
    -   No "Shop Manager" link for artisans.
    -   No "Become a Seller" onboarding flow.

## Phase 7: Industry-Grade Architecture Plan
*Goal: Implement a secure, Etsy-inspired unified user flow.*

### A. Unified Identity Schema
We will link the User and Artisan worlds.
1.  **Users Table**: Add `role` ("user", "admin") and `artisanId` (optional link to their shop).
2.  **Artisans Table**: Add `userId` (owner).
3.  **Permissions**: All mutations will strictly verify: `item.artisanId === currentUser.artisanId`.

### B. Etsy-Inspired Navigation Flow
The UX will be restructured to handle dual roles (Buyer + Seller) seamlessly.

**1. The "Etsy" Header**
-   **Logged Out**: Sign In / Join.
-   **Logged In (Buyer)**:
    -   User Avatar Dropdown:
        -   *Profile*: "View your profile" (Public).
        -   *Orders*: "Purchases and reviews".
        -   *Action*: "Sell on Karu" (Links to Onboarding).
        -   *Settings*: "Account settings", "Sign out".
-   **Logged In (Artisan)**:
    -   **Shop Manager Icon**: Dedicated link to `/dashboard` (next to Cart).
    -   User Dropdown: Same as buyer, but "Sell on Karu" becomes "Shop Manager".

### C. Self-Serve Artisan Onboarding (Option A)
Users can self-promote to Artisans.
1.  **Route `/sell`**: Landing page ("Join the community of makers").
2.  **Route `/onboarding`**: Protected wizard.
    -   Step 1: Shop Name & Details.
    -   Step 2: Story & Process.
    -   Step 3: Location & Categories.
3.  **Completion**: Creates `Artisan` record, updates `User` record, redirects to `/dashboard`.

### D. Secure Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
Replaces the insecure `/admin`.
-   **Context-Aware**: Does not accept `?artisanId=`. Instead, queries `getCurrentUser()` -> finds `artisanId` -> loads *that* data.
-   **Features**:
    -   **Overview**: Sales, visits, pending orders.
    -   **Products**: Add/Edit *my* products only.
    -   **Orders**: Manage orders containing *my* items.

## Next Steps (Implementation Checklist)

### Step 1: Schema Migration
- [ ] Update `schema.ts`: Add `role` to users (via auth adapter config or separate table strategy) and `userId` to artisans.
- [ ] Create `migrate_users` script to assign roles to existing users.

### Step 2: Authentication & Header
- [ ] Update `Header.tsx` to support the "Etsy-style" dropdown.
- [ ] Create `UserMenu` component (Avatar + Dropdown).
- [ ] Implement `useCurrentUser` hook that fetches the extended user profile (including `artisanId`).

### Step 3: Artisan Onboarding
- [ ] Create `/sell` landing page.
- [ ] Create `/onboarding` wizard (using React Hook Form).
- [ ] Implement `registerArtisan` mutation in Convex.

### Step 4: Secure Dashboard
- [ ] Create `/dashboard` layout (Sidebar + Content).
- [ ] Refactor `convex/admin.ts` to `convex/dashboard.ts`:
    -   Remove `artisanId` arguments.
    -   Derive `artisanId` from `auth.getUserId()`.
    -   Add strict security checks.
- [ ] Migrate Product & Order management UI to `/dashboard`.

### Step 5: Platform Admin (Optional)
- [ ] Move current `/admin` to `/platform-admin`.
- [ ] Restrict access to `user.role === 'admin'`.

## Quick Start
```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # Start Vite dev server
npx convex dev      # Start Convex backend (in separate terminal)
```
Open http://localhost:5173

## Environment Variables
For production (Vercel), ensure the following are set:
- `VITE_CONVEX_URL`: Your Convex deployment URL (from `npx convex dev` or Convex dashboard).
- `SITE_URL`: (In Convex Dashboard) Your Vercel deployment URL (e.g., `https://karu-bd.vercel.app`).
